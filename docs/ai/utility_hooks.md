# Utility Hooks

## Purpose
This document describes the custom React hooks used within the codebase. These hooks encapsulate reusable logic, promoting cleaner and more maintainable components.

## Key Files and Directories
- `src/lib/useQuestionCache.ts`: A custom hook for caching question data.
- `src/lib/useSwipe.ts`: A custom hook for handling swipe gestures.

## Functionality
Each file in `src/lib/` that starts with `use` is a custom React hook.
- `useQuestionCache`: Likely provides mechanisms to store and retrieve question data efficiently, reducing redundant API calls.
- `useSwipe`: Provides an interface for detecting and responding to swipe gestures on touch-enabled devices.

These hooks abstract complex logic, allowing components to focus solely on rendering UI.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **New Hook Generation:** LLMs can generate new custom hooks for common patterns (e.g., form handling, debouncing, local storage interaction) based on functional descriptions.
- **Hook Logic Refinement:** LLMs can refine the internal logic of existing hooks, optimize performance, or add new features.
- **Hook Integration:** LLMs can assist in integrating new or existing hooks into components, ensuring proper usage and state management.
