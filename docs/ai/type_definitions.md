# Type Definitions

## Purpose
This document describes the TypeScript type definitions used throughout the codebase. These definitions ensure type safety, improve code readability, and facilitate better development experience by providing clear data structures.

## Key Files and Directories
- `src/types/question.ts`: Defines the TypeScript interfaces or types related to question data.

## Functionality
The `question.ts` file exports interfaces or types that define the structure of question objects, including their properties and their respective data types. These types are then imported and used across various parts of the application (e.g., components, API calls, hooks) to enforce type consistency.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **New Type Definition Generation:** LLMs can generate new TypeScript interfaces or types based on data models or API specifications.
- **Type Definition Refinement:** LLMs can refine existing type definitions, add new properties, or adjust types based on evolving data structures.
- **Type Inference Assistance:** LLMs can assist developers in correctly applying and inferring types throughout the codebase, reducing type-related errors.
- **Schema Validation:** LLMs could help in generating runtime schema validation based on TypeScript types.
