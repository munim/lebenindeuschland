# Business Feature: Information and Help

## Purpose
This document describes the business feature that provides users with access to helpful information and guidance within the application. This improves usability and reduces the need for external support.

## Key Components and Logic
- `src/components/KeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx`: Displays a modal detailing available keyboard shortcuts.
- `src/components/InfoToggle.tsx`: A general toggle component that might reveal contextual information or tips.

## User Flow
1.  User seeks information or help within the application.
2.  They can access a modal for keyboard shortcuts to learn about efficient navigation.
3.  They might encounter `InfoToggle` components that provide contextual help when activated.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **Dynamic Help Content:** LLMs could generate dynamic help content or FAQs based on the user's current context or common queries.
- **Intelligent Tooltips/Walkthroughs:** LLMs could power intelligent tooltips or guided walkthroughs for new features or complex interactions.
- **Contextual Support:** LLMs could provide real-time, context-aware support by analyzing user actions and offering relevant information.
- **Help Document Generation:** LLMs could assist in generating comprehensive help documentation based on the application's features and user flows.
