# Configuration

## Purpose
This document describes how application-wide configurations and settings are managed within the codebase. This centralizes important constants and settings, making them easily accessible and modifiable.

## Key Files and Directories
- `src/config/app.ts`: Contains general application configurations, such as constants, feature flags, or external service URLs.

## Functionality
The `app.ts` file exports configuration objects or individual constants that are used throughout the application. This allows for easy modification of application behavior without deep code changes.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **New Configuration Addition:** LLMs can add new configuration variables or objects to `app.ts` based on new feature requirements.
- **Configuration Value Updates:** LLMs can update existing configuration values (e.g., API endpoints, default settings) as needed.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** LLMs could assist in designing and implementing more dynamic configuration systems, potentially fetching settings from an external source.
