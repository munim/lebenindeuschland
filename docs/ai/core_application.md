# Core Application and Pages

## Purpose
This document describes the core application structure and main pages of the codebase. It outlines how the application's primary routes and overall layout are managed.

## Key Files and Directories
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Defines the root layout of the application, including shared UI elements, metadata, and global styles.
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Represents the main landing page or home page of the application.
- `src/app/globals.css`: Contains global CSS styles applied across the entire application.
- `src/app/favicon.ico`: The favicon for the application.

## Functionality
The `src/app` directory leverages Next.js's App Router to manage routing and layout.
- `layout.tsx` wraps all pages, providing a consistent structure (e.g., header, footer, navigation).
- `page.tsx` serves as the entry point for the main content of the application.
- Global styles are managed in `globals.css`.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **New Page Creation:** LLMs can be used to generate new pages (`page.tsx`) with specific content and integrate them into the existing layout.
- **Layout Modifications:** LLMs can assist in modifying the `layout.tsx` to add new sections, change navigation, or update global components.
- **Global Style Updates:** LLMs can generate or modify CSS rules in `globals.css` based on design requirements.
