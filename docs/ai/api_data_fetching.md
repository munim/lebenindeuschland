# API and Data Fetching

## Purpose
This document describes how the application interacts with external APIs to fetch and manage data. It outlines the core logic for making API requests and handling responses.

## Key Files and Directories
- `src/lib/api.ts`: Contains functions and utilities for making API calls.

## Functionality
The `api.ts` file likely encapsulates methods for interacting with a backend API, handling request parameters, response parsing, and error handling. This centralizes data fetching logic, making it easier to manage and test.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **New API Endpoints:** LLMs can generate new functions within `api.ts` to interact with new API endpoints, including defining request parameters and expected response structures.
- **Request/Response Transformation:** LLMs can assist in modifying existing API functions to transform request payloads or parse complex API responses into desired formats.
- **Error Handling Improvements:** LLMs can suggest and implement more robust error handling mechanisms for API calls, including retry logic or specific error message parsing.
- **Authentication Integration:** LLMs could help integrate authentication tokens or headers into API requests.
