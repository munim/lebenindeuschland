# UI Components

## Purpose
This document describes the reusable UI components within the codebase. These components are designed to be modular, promoting consistency and reusability across the application.

## Key Files and Directories
- `src/components/`: This directory contains all the individual React components.
    - `CategorySelector.tsx`
    - `CollapsibleFilterBar.tsx`
    - `ErrorBoundary.tsx`
    - `Footer.tsx`
    - `InfoToggle.tsx`
    - `KeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx`
    - `LanguageSelector.tsx`
    - `Pagination.tsx`
    - `QuestionCard.tsx`
    - `SettingsModal.tsx`
    - `StateSelector.tsx`
    - `TestModeToggle.tsx`
    - `ThemeToggle.tsx`

## Functionality
Each file in `src/components/` represents a distinct UI component with its own specific functionality. For example:
- `CategorySelector.tsx`: Allows users to select categories.
- `QuestionCard.tsx`: Displays a single question.
- `SettingsModal.tsx`: Provides a modal for application settings.
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Toggles between different themes.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **New Component Generation:** LLMs can generate new React components based on descriptions or wireframes, including their JSX structure, styling, and basic logic.
- **Component Modification:** LLMs can modify existing components to add new props, update styling, or refactor their internal logic.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** LLMs can suggest and implement accessibility enhancements (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation) for components.
- **Storybook Integration:** LLMs could assist in generating Storybook stories for components to improve documentation and testing.
