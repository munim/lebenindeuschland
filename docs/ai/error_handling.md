# Business Feature: Error Handling

## Purpose
This document describes the application's approach to handling and displaying errors to the user. Effective error handling improves user experience by providing clear feedback and preventing application crashes.

## Key Components and Logic
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`: A React Error Boundary component designed to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI.

## User Flow
1.  An unexpected error occurs within a component wrapped by an `ErrorBoundary`.
2.  Instead of crashing the entire application, the `ErrorBoundary` catches the error.
3.  A user-friendly fallback UI is displayed, informing the user of the issue.
4.  (Optional) Error details are logged for developers to investigate.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **Intelligent Error Messages:** LLMs could generate more descriptive and actionable error messages for users, guiding them on how to resolve issues or what steps to take next.
- **Automated Error Reporting:** LLMs could assist in setting up automated error reporting systems, categorizing errors, and suggesting potential fixes based on error patterns.
- **Proactive Error Prevention:** By analyzing code and potential failure points, LLMs could suggest code modifications to prevent common errors before they occur.
- **Debugging Assistance:** LLMs could provide debugging suggestions or even generate code snippets to help resolve identified errors.
