# Business Feature: User Settings and Preferences

## Purpose
This document describes the business feature that allows users to customize their application experience through various settings and preferences. This enhances user satisfaction and caters to individual needs.

## Key Components and Logic
- `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx`: Provides a centralized modal interface for all user settings.
- `src/components/LanguageSelector.tsx`: Allows users to select their preferred language.
- `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`: Enables users to switch between different visual themes (e.g., light/dark mode).
- `src/components/TestModeToggle.tsx`: Allows users to activate or deactivate a "test mode" for specific functionalities.
- `src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`: Manages the application's language state.
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`: Manages the application's theme state.
- `src/contexts/TestModeContext.tsx`: Manages the application's test mode state.

## User Flow
1.  User accesses the settings modal (e.g., via a gear icon).
2.  Within the modal, the user can:
    *   Change the application language.
    *   Toggle between light and dark themes.
    *   Enable or disable a "test mode" feature.
3.  Changes are applied immediately or upon saving, and persist across sessions (if implemented).

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **Intelligent Default Settings:** LLMs could analyze user behavior or device settings to suggest optimal default settings for new users.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on user preferences, LLMs could recommend specific content or features.
- **Natural Language Setting Control:** LLMs could enable users to change settings using natural language commands (e.g., "switch to dark mode," "change language to German").
- **A/B Testing of Settings:** LLMs could assist in designing and analyzing A/B tests for different default settings or preference options.
