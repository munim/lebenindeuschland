# Business Feature: Question Display and Navigation

## Purpose
This document describes the core business feature related to displaying questions to the user and allowing them to navigate through them. This is central to the application's primary function of presenting educational content.

## Key Components and Logic
- `src/app/page.tsx`: The main page where questions are likely displayed.
- `src/components/QuestionCard.tsx`: Renders individual question content.
- `src/components/Pagination.tsx`: Handles navigation between different sets of questions.
- `src/components/CategorySelector.tsx`: Allows users to filter questions by category.
- `src/components/StateSelector.tsx`: Allows users to filter questions by state.
- `src/lib/api.ts`: Used for fetching question data.
- `src/lib/useQuestionCache.ts`: Optimizes question data loading.
- `data/lid_questions.tsv`: Source of question data.

## User Flow
1.  User lands on the main page.
2.  Questions are fetched and displayed, possibly with initial filters applied.
3.  User can navigate through questions using pagination.
4.  User can filter questions by category or state.
5.  Individual questions are presented in a clear, readable format.

## LLM Enhancement Opportunities
- **Intelligent Question Filtering:** LLMs could enhance filtering by understanding natural language queries (e.g., "show me questions about history from Bavaria") and translating them into filter parameters.
- **Adaptive Question Sequencing:** LLMs could suggest or implement logic for presenting questions in an adaptive sequence based on user performance or learning patterns.
- **Dynamic Content Generation:** For certain question types, LLMs could generate variations of questions or explanations to enhance learning.
- **Search Functionality:** LLMs could power a robust search feature for questions, understanding synonyms and context.
- **Personalized Learning Paths:** LLMs could analyze user progress and recommend specific categories or types of questions to focus on.
